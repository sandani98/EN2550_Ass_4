# EN2550_Assignment_04
This assignment is based on Neural Networks.
The first part is a standard neural network with a linear classifier. The second part is a two layer FC network with a hidden layer with standard gradient descent. The third part is the same network with mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD). The Fourth part is a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN).
